# Pouria Toopchi's Code
I am a Masters Graduate in Artificial Intelligence and am currently searching for a Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist role. Above I have composed some examples to showcase my coding ability.

This Repository Contains:
1. [Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/ptoopchi/sample-code/tree/main/Genetic_Algorithm/src) - Genetic Algorithm with uniform crossover in custom 2D landscape
2. [Automated Negotiation Agent](https://github.com/ptoopchi/sample-code/tree/main/Negotiation_Agent/group9) - Agent performs negotiation with other agents within the GENIUS Package
3. [Automated Stock Checker](https://github.com/ptoopchi/sample-code/tree/main/Stock_Check) - Automatically checks stocks across several websites and informs the user when an item is available. 
4. [Two Input Neural Network](https://github.com/ptoopchi/sample-code/tree/main/PyTorch_2NN) - Combines numerical and text features (two inputs) to create an LSTM neural network to detect whether a user is a malicious bot
5. [NLP Data Visualisation](https://github.com/ptoopchi/sample-code/blob/main/NLP_Data_Visualisation.ipynb) - Data Visualisation to compare the difference between human Twitter users and bot Twitter users
6. [Hybrid Recommendation System](https://github.com/ptoopchi/sample-code/tree/main/Recommendation_System) - A hybrid recommendation system recommends different movies to watch based on users history. This model combines a content-based model and a user-based collaborative filtering model.
